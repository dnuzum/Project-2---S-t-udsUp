        <h3>Why?</h3>
        <p>The purpose of this site is to bring together soccer enthusiasts of all experience levels. Whether you are a novice or a lifelong supporter, it is time to come together to share The Beautiful Game with all those around you. Have a friend that is interested in the sport, but has no idea where to begin? Are you a diehard, but have no friends to watch with? Come together, make new friends, and support your colors!</p>
        <p>This is inspired by <a href="http://www.thefreebeermovement.com/pages/about/">The Free Beer Movement.</a> Are we guaranteeing free beer for anyone willing to watch a game? We'll leave that up to the community. But, what we do guarantee is a good time no matter what the outcome. Soccer is a passion that can bring you to your lowest lows and your highest highs. It's a roller coaster.</p>
