#### Derek Nuzum - WDI SEA 06 Project 2

__Overview:__

An app developed to connect Soccer novices with fanatics through the medium of beer. Whether it be at a local pub or an actual match, the goal is to spread a love for The Beautiful Game and make friends at the same time.

__User Stories:__

1. I am new to the sport so I want to learn about my local club from existing supporters.
2. I am a local supporter wanting to find new members to teach the sport and make friends.
3. I am a supporter with no one to meet up with and would like to support my club with other supporters.
